Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Uses Microelectromechanical Systems that combine electrical and mechanical engineering to create mini sensors that are quickly packaged 
A) Accelerometers
How it works: 
- Accelerometers detect the linear motion of objects; they measure the acceleration of an object of 3 planes, x,y, and z. Remember
they do not measure the speed of the object, only the acceleration.
- Parts:
Proof / Seismic Mass = H-shaped structure that holds several sense fingers
Substrate = Tethered to proof mass such that together, it can move back and forth
Electrode = Are stationary and can form capacitance (C = ÎµA / d) without touching the proof mass but keeping the distance low.
- Scenario: 
Let's create a scenario with two stationary plates (electrode) and a moving plate (proof mass). 
It is called a differential capacitor.
Now, (refer to the picture)* imagine the distance between the lower and the middle plane (C/mb) equal to the middle and the top plate (C/mt)
If the middle plate moves down closer to the lower plate, (C/mb) will increase, and (C/mt) will decrease. 
As the proof mass moves back and forth, the capacitance constantly changes. 
The difference in capacitance -> charge amplification -> signal conditioning -> low pass filtering -> Digital Signal via an ADC
