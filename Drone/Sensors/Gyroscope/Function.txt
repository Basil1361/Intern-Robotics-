# Gyrometer: How does it work
# Overview:
The gyroscope measures the angular velocity of the x, y, and z planes. Remember, it does not measure the angle; it measures how fast the robot moves for respective planes.

How it works: 
# Because the accelerometer and gyroscope are built into IMU, it's better to use an example to help.
1) MPU-6050 
- 6-axis motion tracking device, 3-axis for accelerometer, 3-axis for the gyroscope
2) PinOut
- VCC supplies the Module
- GND is the ground pin
- SCL is the serial clock pin for the i2c interface
- SDA is the serial data pin for the i2c interface
- XDA is the external data pin for sensors such as magnetometer
- XCL is the external clock pin.
- AD0 changes the i2c address so that it does not cause conflict during communication. 
- INT is the OUTPUT Pin, like a response pin that can shake, tap, etc. 
3) Methods of Rotation
- X-axis = Roll
- Y-axis = Pitch
- Z-axis = Yaw
4) Coriolis Effect
Basic Explanation:
- "Alright, imagine you're spinning on a merry-go-round at the playground. If you try to throw a ball straight to your friend across from you, something weird happens—the ball doesn’t go straight! It seems to curve to the side. Why? The merry-go-round is spinning, and you’re in a moving system.
- That’s how the Coriolis effect works, but instead of a merry-go-round, it happens on Earth because the planet is spinning.
