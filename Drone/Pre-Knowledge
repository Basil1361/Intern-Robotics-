# Drones:
1. Explaining How the drones fly: 
A) Lift
- When the propellers spin very fast, the airfoil generates a lift force due to the difference in pressure in layers of the airfoil
- The Lift force must >= weight to lift in constant velocity or accelerate its motion. 

B) Thrust (For Quadcopters)
- When the drone wants to go forward, its rear propellers will accelerate while the front propellers will slow down, which creates
a resultant torque, ↖️ direction.
- When ↖️ and ⬆️ exist, horizontal force ⬅️ must be present to balance the resultant force.

C) Yaw Motion (For Quadcopters)
- Moving Itself in the z-axis. Imagine yourself self-rotating on a fixed point. 
- Diagonal propellers will be spun opposite to the other pair to cancel out self-rotation.
- When the drone wants to spin clockwise, the clockwise spinning propellers will decelerate, while the anticlockwise spinning propellers will accelerate.
- The drone will not suddenly drop because the acceleration cancels the deceleration.

2. Concept:
A) One propeller Drones (Unicopter)
- For Basic Design, it normally moves up and down
- Due to Newton's Third Law, the body will rotate opposite the propeller. 
- When the rotor exerts a clockwise or anticlockwise force, the stator (fixed at the drone) must oppose that motion
to balance it out. 
- A rotating base opposing to the propeller is not desirable

B) Two propeller Drones (Bicopters)
- One Clockwise rotation, One Anticlockwise rotation. Able to counteract torque generated by each other, resulting in zero 
torque movement. 
- Theory is, lesser propellers = save battery = higher timespan on the air. 
- The problem is that these drones struggle at sharp turns and higher speeds due to the inability to control the propellers well.

C) Three propeller Drones (Tricopters)
- Rarely Used
- The problem lies in the resultant torque of the drone; some motor has different speeds (RPM) compared to others, which makes it complicated

D) Four propeller Drones (Quadcopters)
- Commonly used in every drone
- consists of 2 types of shapes, X-shaped and H-shaped
- very stable.

3. Components (Brief Explanation) 
- Modern drones use MEM technology, which the size of the sensors can be comparable to ants.
- [B, C, D] are placed together in the Initial Measurement Unit (IMU), the king of sensors 

A) Flight Controller
- The very "brain" of the drone, like a motherboard
- Controls every command of the drone: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Yaw, etc.
- Connected with sensors. 

B) Accelerometers (Calculate Acceleration)
- As the drone experiences force, movement occurs between the plates.  
- The plates have capacitance; when the distance between plates changes, the capacitance changes too. 
# imagine capacitance like buckets of water storing electricity
- The capacitance variation can be easily converted into electrical signals, sending the data to the Processing Chip and the Flight Controller.
- In real life, we have three accelerometers for the x, y, and z planes and three gyroscopic Sensors to measure rotations
C) Barometer Sensor
- Detects altitude from drone to ground

4. Modern challenges 
- Of course, not everything is perfect. There might be turbulence, interference (mechanical vibration of propellers, magnetic interference)  
noise (defect), sensor issues, etc. Despite this, how do drones can reduce errors?
A) Solution: Sensor Fusion
- Using multiple sensors to work together
- Ex: IMU + GPS can tell us about the basic altitude (x,y,z) plane of the drone. However, implementing a radar system makes the information 
more accurate. 
B) Control Logic
- Set of algorithm that reduces error
- An example of an algorithm is the Kalman Filter, which reads past and present data to know the state of the drone and uses its logic to know it's 
GPS location.

5. Communication
- Drone receives communication using Kalman Radio Frequency Technology
- Drones typically have communication ranges between 1-2km
- If Drones exceed this limit, modern technology connects it with GPS or Satellite, such that it will receive a message to return to it's user
